# ai-sdm-demo-app

AI-powered Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) demo app using GBIF API data. Foundation for future web app extensions with Shiny or Dash.

## Overview

This repository contains a starter application for building AI-enhanced Species Distribution Models (SDM) using biodiversity data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API or similar data sources.

## Features

- Access and process species occurrence data from GBIF API
- Implement species distribution modeling algorithms
- AI/ML integration for enhanced prediction capabilities
- Modular design for easy extension

## Future Development

This project is designed as a foundation for web application development using:
- **Shiny** (R): For interactive R-based web applications
- **Dash** (Python): For interactive Python-based web applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- R (3.6+) or Python (3.7+)
- API access to GBIF or similar biodiversity data sources

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Simonkipkurui/ai-sdm-demo-app.git
cd ai-sdm-demo-app
```

├── sdm_analysis.R        # R implementation placeholder
└── sdm_analysis.py       # Python implementation placeholder
```

## Usage

Placeholder scripts are provided for both R and Python implementations. These will be expanded to include:
- Data fetching from GBIF API
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and validation
- Prediction and visualization
